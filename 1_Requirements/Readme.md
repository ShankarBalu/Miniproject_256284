## Introduction
 Hangman is a word guessing game played by two players. One player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The name is given because of the way in which the game progress is shown. The game process is shown by a sketch of a man being hanged.

## Research
### How the game is played? 
(https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Hangman)
1. A word is chosen for the player to guess.
2. The number of words is symbollically conveyed to the user by drawing blank lines in each word.
3. The player is asked for a letter. If the letter is present in the word it is written in the respective positions above the blank lines. If the letter is not present, then the sketch of a man hanging is started.
4. The process continues till all the letters of the word has been guessed or till the sketch is completed.
5. The user wins if the word is completed before the complete sketch is drawn.
